				<h2>Dear Reader,</h2>
					<p>"Since I began Lost Fables in 2015, a lot has evolved with it. As with any new project there are many initial plans which didn't make the cut and new ideas took their place. As the project has evolved, so have my own skills in web development meaning this project did exactly what I set out for it to do. Help me to improve myself with something fun and interactive. It is now that I have come this far that I wish to redevelop exactly what Lost Fables is.</p>
					<p>The first version of Lost Fables started out as a place for people to share publications with one another, while the intention was sound, the execution was somewhat lacking. The site lay dorment for some time until the point my other project 'Novel Tea Games' was ready to release it's Visual Novel 'Runeous' in which Lost Fables became the 'Publishing Entity.' I soon moved on to help others in their Visual Novel publishing and evolved the site around that.</p>
					<p>Publishing was simply something to give purpose to the site during it's 'down-time' for development and now it's time to renew the original idea and turn Lost Fables into the site it was meant to be but with a little more 'flare'.</p>
					<p>I am officially welcoming you to help with the testing phase by becoming a Beta-Tester to the site. As a personal 'thank-you' those who stick around and help throughout the entire testing process will be added to a 'premium' list and will benefit from any 'Premium Membership' perks which may be introduced in the future.</p>
					<p>It's easy to help out since all you will need to do is upload your content, test features and comment on what you think works well, could be improved upon or should be implemented. You will be able to shape the way the site looks and functions, becoming a key part of this community!"</p>
